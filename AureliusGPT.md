## Motivations

I have always been deeply captived by philosophy from a young age. I first read [_Meditations_ by Marcus Aurelius](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2680/pg2680-images.html) in 7th grade, and became enthralled by the concepts of Stoicism and accepting what is out of one's hands. This led me to [Seneca's _Letters from a Stoic_](https://www.amazon.com/Letters-Penguin-Classics-Lucius-Annaeus/dp/0140442103), [Epictetus' _The Discourses_](https://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/discourses.html), and one of my favorites, [_The Fragments of Zeno and Cleanthes_ by Zeno](https://www.amazon.com/Fragments-Zeno-Cleanthes-Stoic/dp/1013465202). However, _Meditations_ was the foundational text that encouraged me to explore the Stoic school of philosophy. Therefore, I made a decision to pretrain my first, miniscule language model on this principle work. Having technical experience in LLMs before this project, I realized training on such an incredibly small corpora (in the context of language model scaling laws) would be challenging and I would significantly risk overfitting, but I made the decision to go for it anyway. The result is my first self-pretrained model, AureliusGPT. You can find more information on AureliusGPT below, or view the HuggingFace or GitHub.

# Technical Spec (Also Visible on GitHub/HuggingFace)

## Overview

AureliusGPT-Torch is an 845k, PyTorch and SentencePiece boosted SLM pretrained on _Meditations_ by Marcus Aurelius and other adjacent philosophical works. It is a larger size, more comprehensive reimplementation of 
[AureliusGPT](https://github.com/tarush-ai/AureliusGPT), a smaller model trained on the same core corpus, but using a handwritten/NumPy first (zero PyTorch or prewritten tokenizer) approach.

Rather than reimplementing a custom BPE algorithm and tokenizer backpropagation from scratch like its sibling repo, AureliusGPT-Torch trains SentencePiece on its corpus (detailed in Data) and relies on PyTorch for autograd.

The [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/Tarush-AI/AureliusGPT) for this model (including both the base model weights at epoch 10 and the tokenizer/vocabulary) are contained here. 

This work was not possible without [Project Gutemberg's opensource _Meditations_](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2680/pg2680-images.html). A full license is listed at the end of this README.

## Usage

To get started, run:

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you wish to have a "Stoic Validator," please create a .env file of the format:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY = sk_proj_YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE
```

Alternatively, you can run from CLI and make the necessary changes:
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk_proj_YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE
```

A future version of this model will rely on the finetuned Llama 3.2 1B parameter model as the validator. 

To finetune the teacher model for distillation / synthetic data generation, open the Colab Notebook (model/datageneration/llama321b_meditations_lora_unsloth.ipynb) and run it on the provided Tesla T4 GPU. If the data has not been generated, training will rely on the core _Meditations_ corpus. Future versions of this repository will have the synthetic data generation pipeline / Unsloth package library wrapped into the core repository with GPU plugin/handling.

To run training from the source directory, run:
```
python -m model.train
```

To run the model in CLI, run:
```
python -m model.run
```

If you want to experiment with the preprocessing or tokenization logic in the corpus, .test() functions have been wrapped into both. You can try both:

```
python -m model.vocabulary.tokenizer test
python -m model.vocabulary.preprocess test 
```

Or, if you have your own unique testfile (this may yield errors due to the hyperspecific nature of these files:
```
python -m model.vocabulary.tokenizer test YOUR_RELATIVE_FILEPATH_HERE
python -m model.vocabulary.preprocess test YOUR_RELATIVE_FILEPATH_HERE
```

## Data
The original corpus of _Meditations_ by Marcus Aurelius is 89k tokens approximately when tokenized by a SentencePiece BPE tokenizer trained on a vocabulary length of 2,000. Using Kaplan et al. Chinchilla scaling laws,
the expected parameter size of the model would be 8.9k parameters (taking the less conservative 1:10 ratio of parameters to corpus tokens). However, given the smaller size of the model and its lack of focus on general intelligence (instead, focused on generating Stoic-adjacent, Aurelius flavored text), this ratio does not apply.

Given the risk of these models to heavily overfit, optimizing the ratio (even if there are more parameters than there are tokens) is critical. Therefore, I required another corpus of data that I did not have access to.

As a result, I turned to the strategy of using *Off Policy, Sequence Level Knowledge Distillation* from a larger model (Llama 3.2 1B). First, I finetuned the model on the corpus of meditations using [Unsloth AI's notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/unslothai/notebooks/blob/main/nb/Llama3.2_(1B_and_3B)-Conversational.ipynb).
Then, I used it to generate approximately 122k tokens of synthetic data over 100 iterations asking it common stoic prompts. I used Google Colab's inbuilt Tesla T4 GPU to run this data generation, which took about 1.5 hours. I do not match logits or trajectories, only generated text; therefore, this approach also pulls elements from instruct-style distillation or offline student-teacher SFT methods. 
Note: I did not run it from the project directory due to my lack of GPU configuration; however, the adapted notebook has been included.

One critical limitation in this approach is the inefficacy of my prompt library: I did not explicitly instruct the model to focus on _Meditations_ by Marcus Aurelius, enabling the model to hallucinate and pull from various sources of data.
Future iterations of AureliusGPT-Torch will account for this problem thoroughly to avoid brittle LoRA memory being further defeated, or move to another fine tuning/RL based technique. The core point of this corpus of data was to source philosophical, 
Stoic or Stoic adjacent data to ensure better generation quality.

My preprocessing logic between AureliusGPT-Torch and AureliusGPT is the same; I rely on Greek transliterations, Unicode normalization, regex patterns, and special "<BEGIN>", "<END>", and "<PAD>" (at training time) tokens.
I take a similar approach for my preprocessing of _Meditations_ corpus to feed into LoRA; to avoid confusion between Llama 3.2 1B's internal tokens and mine, I avoid adding them in, instead semantically replacing them after the corpus has been generated.

I added the Meditations data twice to the final corpus to weight its significance, especially given its lower token count and the lower quality of synthetic data. My training split was 80% of the pure Meditations data and all the synthetic data; my validation split was 20% of the pure Meditations data.

## Architecture

### Overview
I use PyTorch's weight initialization (as opposed to a Gaussian process W ~ 𝒩(0, 0.02) for my manual AureliusGPT). I rely on the Transformer architecture from Attention is All You Need (Vaswani et al.) in my implementation.
Given the small scale of this project, all training (except for the Llama 3.2 1B LoRA for synthetic data) was conducted on a local CPU, and was sequential (not concurrent, hence my lack of ThreadPool or ProcessPoolExecutor).
I rely on a PostNorm, 6 Transformer block architecture for AureliusGPT-Torch of the format

GPT -> {TransformerBlock -> TransformerBlock -> TransformerBlock...}x6 -> logits
TransformerBlock -> {AttentionBlock -> Add/Norm -> FFN -> Add/Norm}
AttentionBlock -> {AttentionHead + Concatenation}

### Embeddings
I use sinusoidal positional embeddings; given my low parameter budget, I thought it was economical to avoid learning them. My core embedding matrix E is learned.

### Attention
I use multihead attention in this project, as well as a causal attention mask.

### LayerNorm
I use PyTorch's inbuilt LayerNorm rather than my own implementation.


## Training

### Overview

As mentioned earlier, I incorporate a train/val split of 80:20. I also compute the training and validation loss, as well as the gradient normalization to track overfitting. 
num_epochs=50 is too high a number; you can using matplotlib graph the relevant losses and identify signs of overfitting during experiments. There is a clear route to On Policy Distillation
and feedback loops/PPO, RLHF, or RLAIF; there is a method in the original Unsloth AI notebook to save the LoRA weights of the _Meditations_ tuned teacher model to HuggingFace, which can be leveraged as a teacher 
model in the future. 

### Inference 

While I rely on Off Policy, Sequence Level Knowledge Distillation with Llama 3.2 1B as outlined in my Data section, there is a clear route to implementing Best of N Sampling through concurrent model generations and rankings.
This can again rely on the finetuned Llama 3.2 1B model or any comparable instruct model on its level.

This model, once fully completed, will be put on HuggingFace and hosted on my website (tarush.ai/aureliusgpt-torch). 

## Future Work on AureliusGPT

### Synthetic Data Generation / Teacher Model

Currently, my LoRA'd Llama 3.2 1B model is run in an ipynb on a Tesla T4 GPU. A future version will integrate the LoRA and synthetic data generation, and relevant GPU plumbing, into the scope of this project. 

Additionally, the universal "teacher/Stoic justifier" model will be the adapted Llama 3.2 1B model, deviating from the OpenAI Chat Completions API GPT-4o approach. 

### Model Visibility on HuggingFace

In a future version, the fitting and accuracy optimized (see Overfitting Tracking / Adaptable Training) files of Llama 3.2 1B's LoRA weights and AureliusGPT-Torch will be loaded onto HuggingFace for fast import and inference.

### Top N Sampling

After the teacher model is converted to Llama 3.2 1B, I will implement config editable concurrent AureliusGPT generation and top N sampling to ensure the highest quality result.

### Overfitting Tracking / Adaptable Training

Currently, training highlights training and validation loss, as well as gradient normalization based on the train/test split to identify overfitting. In a future version, this will be tracked in an easy-to-interpret, modular plot for the user for ease of training.

Beyond weight tuning, config.py will be helpfully automatically adjusted in a future version, changing the learning rate, number of epochs, batch size, and other aspects of training. Therefore, after running n training cycles on its own, the model will iteratively improve its training performance so minimal training optimization is required. 

### Model Upscale

A future project will use the LoRA'd Llama 3.2 1B model to generate signifcantly more parameters of stoic adjacent text, as well as utilizing the works of Zeno, Epictetus, and other famous Stoic thinkers, to build either a Transformer or an MoE model ("Epictetus": _____, "Zeno": _______, "Aurelius": _______) called "StoicDiscourseLM". This will incorporate many elements (including preprocessing functionality) of AureliusGPT but will also be a unique project.


## Sample Outputs

### Overview

Some malformed characters and spacing artifacts are due to SentencePiece segmentation and Unicode normalization interactions at small scale, not post-processing errors. With an increased vocab size and optimized Unicode, these errors would not persist.

The config file used to generate these results is on GitHub, but here are the relevant stats:
```
vocab_size = 4000

num_blocks = 6
d_model = 64
h = 4
d_head = 16
d_ff = 64

#training time
batch_size = 512
num_epochs = 50
max_seq_length = 512
lr = 1e-3

#runtime
max_tokens = 200
temperature = 0.8
justification_model = "gpt-4"
argmax = False     
```


### Sample Output 1: "The world "

AureliusGPT

A model trained on Meditations by Marcus Aurelius.

User: The world

AURELIUS: for us, when therefore even in all shall never be eth, to have no thought to believe not say unto me. If it will this kind of them to strive and by right, is, what respect and that, or wise as a present station, yea it be with such a man, and opportunity to thyself unto himself from all these ever to be bound to be hindered; and to his own proper natural dreams I cannot be his mind.

This ph ed ing to live, and knowledge, only.  

 
Stoic Justification Agent: 
Score: 60/100

Accuracy Report:
The model's generation has semantic, linguistic and Stoic-based connections with Marcus Aurelius' Meditations, but also presents a number of linguistic inaccuracies and inconsistencies. The text maintains a solemn and introspective tone akin to the Stoic philosophy depicted in Meditations, with phrases such as "rational substance," "natural dreams," and "general condition," all of which could plausibly reflect Aurelius’ contemplations on life, existence, and virtue.

Some sentences or phrases, like "Be get ative faculty, and see whatsoever it is of a kind of the true and reason", seem to bear traces of Stoic themes, but their meaning is encumbered by grammatical errors and awkward wording, lowering the overall score.

The phrase "opportunity to thyself unto himself" seems to echo Stoic teachings about self-reliance and introspection, while "man doth subject to live that seemed nor bad and of comm ent orderly man" and "a man might comp are leisure to teach with ance of an honest!" are hard to parse linguistically and thematically, bringing down the score further.

Overall, while the output bears semblances to the Stoic philosophy and style of Marcus Aurelius, the linguistic inaccuracies and incoherencies limit the model's score. Improvements could be made through refining the model's grasp of grammatical structures and semantic context.

### Sample Output 2: "Death "

User: Death

AURELIUS: if one that which ever not to some common good things con ven eth ents unto him, and the whole, but as concer t and the generation of what is inf ition of death dwelt with a blow as it with w ounded which is fitting; but a man would it be said to the vulgar apprehend the several of the feet, and solid th? set to the earth of pleasures? an act ate man ' s upon it, every man as a fool too? when matters, and whatsoever else whereof the whole series of blood of imp ure from all things are very truth, if thou wouldst thou dost think un as to the ext ortion again that perfect simplicity.

Why should be a flood and in thy sympathy with it may but draw thy thoughts and credit must be hindered from the common good things that are they doth resist ed ing. For all things. And yet they have done, upon every one point, who is the same kind.  

 
Stoic Justification Agent: 
Score: 45/100

Accuracy Report:

The model's response is a complex body of text with a lot of various elements involved. Parts of it seem to be relating to stoicism's thoughts on death, the interconnectedness of all things, living in the moment and accepting our natural progression towards death. Words that fit with Aurelius's meditations like "common good", "rational", "nature", "simplicity", and questions about life's actions and the nature of living beings are included, showing the model's capability to generate stoic-based content in line with the author.

However, the output does lose points for coherency and linguistic accuracy - it seems to be piecing together phrases and ideas without a clear flow or a strong connection to the initial prompt of "Death". The composition is difficult to comprehend fully, with several instances of phrases being cut and jumbled up, affecting the readability and comprehension. This creates a somewhat disjointed narrative that might not offer the user a satisfactory response to their prompt.

In semantic terms, the toy model presents various stoic elements like maintaining virtues, contemplating nature, and contemplating life and death, which were central themes in the meditations of Marcus Aurelius. 

The model also presents some reflections on human nature, societal matters, and philosophy, showing its ability to generate content from the training material. However, these reflections are scattered throughout and don't weave into a coherent message.

Overall, considering this is a toy model and its limitations, the generated output shows some application of the stoic principles as seen in Meditations by Marcus Aurelius, but lacks the polish and coherence of the original text.

### Sample Output 3: "Pain is "

AureliusGPT

A model trained on Meditations by Marcus Aurelius.

User: Pain is 

AURELIUS: a common end. Whatsoever is kindly now can be, when the common proper use of all external accidents, as it doth as it be. They cannot be thy pray, doth his own proper and when are now properly be that it were that which above, even the Pl atonic, and upon this fort ified or if a man whosoever of the fig - father against reason with thee, and that common part of conv ulsion.

Stoic Justification Agent: 
This output gets a score of 40/100. 

The model seems to have taken some elements from "Meditations", like the discussions of commonality, the state of being, mortality, and reason, which align fairly well with Stoic philosophies. For instance, Marcus Aurelius often contemplates the nature of humans, life, and existence in the universe, as well as postulates on proper rational behavior. 

However, these themes are drastically overshadowed by the model's incoherency. Semantically, it fails slightly because the output fails to follow a single coherent topic. Instead, there are sudden jumps from one idea to another resulting in lack of contextual associations between sentences. For example, the phrases like "the mind is now", "this end is", or "thy refuge, is but best, nor, though but that which is to the gods, is incidental unto" are hard or impossible to comprehend logically.

From a linguistic perspective, the model fails significantly. There's repetitive usage of certain phrases such as "that which is" and "man", which greatly hampers the text's readability. Moreover, the response is littered with disjointed phrases, narrative inconsistencies, grammatical errors, and meaningless symbols, which makes the text challenging to read and comprehend.

In the context of stoic teachings, while the text vaguely alludes to themes of mortality, human nature, and life's ephemity that Marcus Aurelius often touched upon, it fails to do so in a meaningful or insightful manner. The output hardly embodies stoicism's emphasis on logic, self-discipline, and practical wisdom.

In conclusion, while the model has some alignment with the overall themes of "Meditations", the output lacks coherence, linguistic accuracy, and effective conveyance of Stoic philosophy. Significant work is needed to improve on these areas.

contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
